I love getting more done while having to do less and getting the most bang for my buck because it gives me not only satisfaction but also peace of mind, which I know you too desire. In fact, it’s part of what blew me away about cloud computing when I first learned about AWS years ago.

More importantly, I’ve been captivated by how cloud technology makes the world more agile and more able to respond to new threats like COVID-19, all the more helping me develop an even better appreciation for the societal and economic importance of mobile, agile, and flexible work systems.

Because of the current pandemic, I have come to believe that it is crucial for businesses and government agencies to adopt cloud computing to not just survive but thrive. Otherwise, they will quickly get left behind, and that’s become an increasing concern to me. I want to help people make accomplishments and achieve results so they can have the opportunity to benefit and transform the world.

Throughout my cloud journey (and as a UVA alum), I’ve learned the importance of learning, of staying humble and hungry, no matter how far I’ve come or how much I’ve accomplished. I continue to learn about the cloud along with other technologies and skills so I can continue to be on top of optimizing cloud adoption and maturity.

Perhaps even more importantly, I’ve come to learn that it’s sometimes not about finding the right answers but asking the right questions so you know which way to go, professionally and personally. Because I have come to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools, I believe in developing a people-first culture that prioritizes fairness, integrity, and empathy.

I am excited about helping businesses, government agencies, and everyone in between get into the cloud. Please feel free to connect with and contact me with any thoughts or insights about my work—I’m always interested in making new professional acquaintances.
